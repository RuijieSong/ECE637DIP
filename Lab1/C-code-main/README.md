## System Requirements
1. GCC compiler
2. Unix bash shell environment

## Installation
In order to compile the code execute the following commands in a unix shell.

	cd src
	make

This will compile the code with a gcc compiler and put the executable ``Example`` in the ``bin`` directory.

## Demo
The ``demo`` subdirectory contains a script and an image to run a very simple demo. You can run the demo with the following commands:

	cd demo
	source ./Demo.sh

Then to display the plots for the qGGMRF functions, you can run the script ``PlotData.m`` in Matlab.
